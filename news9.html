<h1>Norweigian researcher exposes how a US firm collected his location data</h1>
<p>Most of us already know that our smartphones are being tracked constantly through either telecommunication service providers, tech giants like Google, or the various apps that we use.</p>
<p>One researcher decided to see where the information or data was collected similar to when a student traced his phoneâ€™s thief.</p>
<p>Detailing his narrative in a blog post, Martin Gundersen starts by requesting information about all the data held on him from a company named Venntel that had been known to provide the U.S Government, more specifically the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with similar information in the past.</p>
