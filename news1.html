 <h1>Cisco fixed flaws in WebEx that allow ghost participants in meetings </h1>
 <p>The vulnerabilities were discovered earlier this year by security by IBM researchers as part of an assessment of the tools used by its personnel for remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

   <p> Ghost participants to a meeting could be seen in the user list, but they can access any media within the meeting, even if they were not invited.</p>
    
   <p>The flaws also allowed attackers to remain in the Webex meeting as ghost audio users after admins would remove them, they also allowed them to access Webex usersâ€™ information, including full names, email addresses, and IP addresses.</p>
